# pytorCH OPtimize: a library for continuous optimization built on PyTorch
 ...with applications to adversarially attacking and training neural networks.
 
:warning: This library is in early development, API might change without notice. The examples will be kept up to date.:warning:

## Stochastic Algorithms
We define stochastic optimizers in the `chop.stochastic` module. These follow PyTorch Optimizer conventions, similar to the `torch.optim` module.

### Examples:
- `examples/training_constrained_net_on_mnist.py` for a model training use case.

## Full Gradient Algorithms

We also define full-gradient algorithms which operate on a batch of optimization problems in the `chop.optim` module. These are used for adversarial attacks, using the `chop.Adversary` wrapper.

### Examples:

- `examples/optim_dynamics.py` for a generic example (one datapoint in the batch)
- `examples/adversarial_robustness/attack_benchmark.py` for how to use our algorithms for adversarial attacks. 

## Tests

Run the tests with `pytests tests`.
